# Day 1: 05/10/2020 - Monday
Today I learnt about the following AWS service

 * Cloudfront - This is a fully managed CDN service offered by AWS. There are Edge locations which are dotted all over the globe which allows customers to cache content closer to their users. 
 
 * Cloudformation - This service allows you to to easily provisional a model environment using IaaC, it will even create all the resources in the correct order. JSON document created for the code which can be re-used
 
 * Route53 - Not much to say about this service apart from it's a fully managed DNS service
 
 * Elastic Beanstalk - This is a very interesting service in my opinion. This service allows developers to upload to and create code in Elastic Beanstalk and they don't have to worry about the underlying infrastrucutre, AWS will automatically provision, maintain and if required scale up / out the infrastructure. It is also highly available
 
 I also learnt what a Datalake is - I've come across the term previously and someone at work mentioned it so I thought i'd look it up - a datalake is essentially a central location where company data is stored so that it can be analyzed
